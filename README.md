## What is the London Company Website?
This project was completed during Week 2 of TechNative Digital’s Software Development: Tech Finishing School.

Working in pairs, we converted a **basic Figma design** into a **structured, semantic HTML webpage**, styled using **CSS**. The focus of the project was on accurately translating a design into code while maintaining clean structure and readable markup.

## Features

- Structured and **semantic HTML**  
- CSS styling based on provided design specifications  
- Pair programming and collaborative development  

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** – Semantic structure and content markup  
- **CSS** – Styling and layout  

## Key Learnings
- Translating design files (Figma) into functional HTML and CSS
